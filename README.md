## Featured Products

The Featured Products page highlights products available at the market with a description of the products and giving names to the stallholders to give it a local community feel. There is an opportunity for further development to include all stallholders and their products. 

## Become a Stallholder

This page is for members of the public who wish to sell at the market. The form allows them to add their name, phone number, email address. The text area includes a placeholder asking the user to give a descripton of what they would like to sell. 

## Possible Additional Features

The Featured Products page was designed to give an idea of what could be included in here, there is an opporutnity to include more products and stallholders. Visually it might be better to reformat the text so that it is inline with the images in order to give more space and provide a better user experience.

After learning how to add a map through the Coders Coffeehouse project, I decided to leave the width as it was. 

#### CSS
One error was found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator. This is a parse error on line 341 which I was unable to delete.
